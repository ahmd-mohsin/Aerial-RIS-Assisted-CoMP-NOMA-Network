    A link is a connection between two transceivers. It is characterized by the

    and the rician_args are used for the LOS component.

    where :math:`g_{t,r}` is the small-scale fading (sampled from a
    distribution), :math:`PL(d_{t,r})` is the path loss, and
    :math:`d_{t,r}` is the distance between the transceivers.
